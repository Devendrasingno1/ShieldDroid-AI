# 🧠 Malware Detection Engine

ShieldDroid-AI uses multiple detection layers.

### Layer 1
Permission Analysis

Checks dangerous permissions like

- READ_SMS
- SEND_SMS
- RECEIVE_SMS
- RECORD_AUDIO
- READ_CONTACTS
- READ_CALL_LOG
- WRITE_SETTINGS
- PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS

---

### Layer 2
Behavior Rules

Detects suspicious combinations of permissions.

Example

```
READ_SMS
+
SEND_SMS
+
RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED
```

↓

Possible SMS Malware

---

### Layer 3
Trusted Application Whitelist

Apps like

- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Chrome
- Gmail
- YouTube

are ignored to reduce false positives.

---

### Layer 4
Risk Scoring

Every detected app receives a Risk Score based on

- Dangerous Permissions
- Suspicious Patterns
- App Category
- Detection Rules

---
